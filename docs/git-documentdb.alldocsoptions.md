How to get documents

<b>Signature:</b>

```typescript
export declare type AllDocsOptions = {
    include_docs?: boolean;
    descendant?: boolean;
    directory?: string;
    recursive?: boolean;
};
```

## Remarks

- include\_docs: Include the document itself in each row in the doc property. Otherwise you only get the \_id and file\_sha properties. Default is false.

- descendant: Sort results in rows by descendant. Default is false (ascendant).

- directory: Only get the documents under the specified sub directory.

- recursive: Get documents recursively from all sub directories. Default is false.
