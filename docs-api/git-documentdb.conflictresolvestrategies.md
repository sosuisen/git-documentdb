## Remarks

'ours' and 'theirs' are borrowed terms from Git (https://git-scm.com/docs/merge-strategies)

- 'ours-prop': (Beta) Accept ours per property. Properties in both local and remote documents are compared and merged. When a remote change is conflicted with a local change, the local change is accepted.

- 'theirs-prop': (Beta) Accept theirs per property. Properties in both local and remote documents are compared and merged. When a remote change is conflicted with a local change, the remote change is accepted.

- 'ours': Accept ours per document (Default). Documents in both local and remote commits are compared and merged per document. When a remote change is conflicted with a local change, the local change is accepted.

- 'theirs': Accept theirs per document. Documents in both local and remote commits are compared and merged per document. When a remote change is conflicted with a local change, the remote change is accepted.

- Compare function that returns one of the strategies ('ours-prop', 'theirs-prop', 'ours', and 'theirs') can be given. Each argument will be undefined when a document is removed.
